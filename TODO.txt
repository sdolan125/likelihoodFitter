Global:
	Change v_pedges and v_cthedges to have more modular names (d1edges, d2edges)
    datatype in fitter is not fit mode in main


In ccqefit.cc:
	dccqebin->binning
	ccqepara->firpara

    TTree *tdata = (TTree*)(fdata->Get("selectedEvents"));
    This defines the name of the tree to look for in the data - for HL2 this should probz be all_syst (maybe default


In inputs/CCQESample.hh


In anaevents/CCQESample.cc
    m_data_tree->SetBranchAddress("weight",&wght); 
    m_data_tree->SetBranchAddress("Pmureco",&pmu_rec_tree);
    m_data_tree->SetBranchAddress("CTHmureco",&cthmu_rec_tree);
    m_data_tree->SetBranchAddress("topology",&topology);  
    These set the branches to be used in the fit, need this to include whatever is relevent for hl2 input
    POT is hardcoded

    if(topology != m_sampleid) continue;
    The ccode selects the sample based on the "topology" branch, in the hl2 case we would probz like to select the sample bases on the first index of accum_level[][]

    Use rtype to decide event topology (code calls it reaction), this is analysis specific but will set up to work with the mectopology category.


In include/ccqeTreeMC.hh 
    const char *trname = "selectedEvents";
    This should be default or all_syst


In xsecfit/XsecFitter
    Swap CCQESample to AnySample (remember includes in the header file!)
    CHECK WHICH FILE HAS THE PROBLEM, IS IT CCQE_ORINAL !!!????????


General: Code currently considers signal to be CCQE, i.e that reaction in the selectedEvents tree is 1. This should be made more modular


In CCQEParameters
        Specify ccqe_recode = 0; Not good
